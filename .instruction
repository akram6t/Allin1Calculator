Project Title: Allin1Calculator

Project Overview:
The "Allin1Calculator" project is designed to offer a multi-functional, web-based platform that provides users with a wide variety of calculators. This all-in-one calculator website will include tools for basic arithmetic, scientific computations, financial estimations, and common unit conversions. The aim is to develop an accessible, clean, and responsive user interface that caters to students, professionals, and the general public.

Technology Stack:
Frontend: React.js (with Context API or Redux)
Backend: Node.js + Express.js
Database: MongoDB (optional, only for storing user preferences or history)
Authentication: Optional (only if personalization is added)
Other Tools:
Chart.js (for visualizing financial calculations)
Math.js (for scientific computations)
Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS (for UI)
Note: If your team is not familiar with any specific technology (e.g., MongoDB), you are free to use alternatives like Firebase or local storage. Make sure performance remains optimal. Avoid using paid tools, APIs, or SDKs that require subscription/license keys. If any feature needs a payment gateway or paid access, skip that part.
